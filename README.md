# Pixxel Assingment

## how to run?

1. run `npm i` to install all dependencies
2. use `npm start` to start react development server

Since this project is also using postcss to compile tailwind css, run `npm run build:watch` in order for tailwind syntax to take effect on the fly

***
To build tailwind css run `npm run build:css` and you will find your build code under `/src/styles/main.css`
